              Picture a world where Van Gogh could sell his 'Starry Night'
              without a gallery taking a sky-high commission. That's OpenStudio
              – a virtual art bazaar where creativity is the currency and fair
              prices are the masterpiece! OpenStudio is designed with the UK art
              scene in mind. We're talking prices in pounds, shipping within the
              British Isles.

              But hold your horses, art aficionados! Before you start throwing
              imaginary millions at digital Monets, let's add some reality to
              this picture. OpenStudio is a student project, as experimental as
              Duchamp's fountain. No real payments, no actual art deliveries –
              just the pure joy of pretend art trading!

              Our Artsy Cast of Characters:
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li className="mb-3">
                <strong>Artists:</strong> Our Kahlos and Kandinskys, showcasing
                their masterpieces in their virtual "Studio". It's like having a
                Parisian atelier, minus the paint fumes and existential crises.
              </li>
              <li className="mb-3">
                <strong>Collectors:</strong> Our art enthusiasts, browsing the
                "Marketplace" like it's the Louvre on free entry day. They can
                'purchase' art without spending a cent and save their favorites
                in their personal "Gallery" – it's like Pinterest for fine art,
                but cooler!
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="title is-4 mt-6 mb-3">How It Works:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li className="mb-3">
                <strong>Marketplace:</strong> Where the magic happens! Browse,
                discover, and 'buy' artworks faster than you can say "abstract
                expressionism".
              </li>
              <li className="mb-3">
                <strong>Gallery:</strong> Your personal art sanctuary. Save your
                favorite pieces here, creating a wishlist that would make even
                Peggy Guggenheim jealous.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="is-size-5 mt-5">
              Remember: No real money changes hands here. Your wallet can relax
              like a Matisse odalisque, and the only thing you'll be charged
              with is having an excess of artistic appreciation!
            </p>
            <p className="is-size-5">
              So come on in, channel your inner Warhol or Basquiat, and dive
              into the world of art collecting – without the hefty price tags.
              It's all the thrill of the art world, with none of the buyer's
              remorse!
